##### Logo re-design for the CT Morgan Horse Association.

##### Old logo. Classic but needed an update.
<br><br>
<div class="centertext">
I was tasked with re-designing a logo for the CT Morgan Horse Association. Let me tell you something about me.
<br><br>
<hr />
**I don't like horses.**
<hr />
<br><br>
I don't have anything against them personally. I've never been bamboozled by a horse. I just don't trust them. They are too big and muscular. I like them in theory but I've been ruined by watching videos online of cowboys get kicked in the head.
<br><br>
This led to some interesting discoveries on my part. Apparently there are different kinds of horses.
<br><br>
Initially I though "I'll just make an elegant, simple horse head. Something with a painterly feel that kind of vibes with the New England horse community." So I created a logo after looking up pictures of horses on Google.

##### First draft. It looks like a horse... just not the right kind of horse.
<br><br>

<div class="centertext">
<h2>Did you know different breeds of horses have different shaped heads?</h2>
</div>

They do. I didn't know that going in. That's ok, it's an easy fix.

##### Boom. Morgan horse.

Just the logo. Nice and clean.

<div class="leftcol">
    ![1](1.jpeg) <br> In the end we wound up with a clean, simple, elegant vector logo that can be used in horse shows or any kind of advertising.
